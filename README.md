Write a short description.
I read this book to my children, and they absolutely loved it so much that, being a paperback, I had to replace it several times because it simply wore out. Then, as parents, they began to talk at a family gathering, about the characters in the book, and how they loved it. I looked through my library of children's books, and my copy was in a sorry state. Expecting my first local grandchild, I replenished my stock. That first baby is now a married 22 year old who is studying to be a Rabbi! He loves children, and loves to read this book to his younger siblings (with 7 siblings, the youngest is 5). The book got worn out again. Now, with 4 great-grandchildren, I have purchased this latest copy and I find that my grown grandchildren love to hear me read it to the younger grandchildren also. I'm waiting for the day when the newest great-grandchild is old enough to listen to the funny story, and see the great pictures, and appreciate the funny names in the book. Of course, the children need to talk afterwards to be informed that the events in it really can't happen, but that's a small price, and I think they already know that it's not real, and the events cannot happen. I highly recommend this book to parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. As you can see, it's well-remembered, and talked about for many, many years.
